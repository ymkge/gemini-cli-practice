# Invaders Game

A simple retro-style space invaders game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Play

1.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2.  Click the **Start** button to begin the game.

### Controls

*   **Arrow Keys (Left/Right):** Move the player ship.
*   **Spacebar:** Fire bullets.
*   **Start Button:** Starts the game.
*   **Stop Button:** Pauses the game.
*   **Reset Button:** Resets the game to its initial state.

## Development

This game is built with plain JavaScript, using object-oriented principles to structure the code. The main game logic is encapsulated within a `Game` class, which manages the player, invaders, bullets, and the game loop.

To run the game locally, you can use a simple HTTP server. If you have Python installed, you can run the following command in the project directory:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

Then, open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
